    **Sync Brightness to Z-Wave Attribute v1.0** ðŸ”›

    This blueprint allows you to easily create/maintain an automation that links the state of multiple entities:
      - set the brightness of any Z-Wave dimmer switch entity, it will set the custom brightness z-wave attribute to that brightness.
        - For Zooz, this is Custom Brightness.
        - For Leviton, this is Initial Brightness.

    **NOTE**: You can select any device and this script will not verify what you provide is accurate, but it will fail if the device is not compatible.

    **CHANGELOG:**
      - 1.0: (2025-01-12)
        - First official release
